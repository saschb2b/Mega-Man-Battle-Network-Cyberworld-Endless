# Tile test: clean tiles in every area

```bash
python3 build.py tiles [SEEDS] [--baseline]
```

The atlas of every area and layout (2 seeds each by default, about three
minutes), and in the areas that have stairs (Sky, the Undernet) as many
layers that climb one, then a table per area: its layers and panels, the tiles drawn
with other floors than they show and the seams per 100 panels, and why the
tiles were drawn off (`src/map/tiles.h`, `TILE_WHY_*`):

- `unseen`: no pair of the area's maps at that place in a panel shows what
  the tile shows. A shape its maps never draw: change the layout, or learn
  from more maps (`net_area.more`).
- `pixels`: pairs that show it cover the floor wrongly here (the pixel
  test: faces and legs of another height or length).
- `plain`: they do not look like the area's plain floor well inside it.
- `ranked`: one would have done and lost to a nearer neighbourhood or a
  seam.

The seams count what the classes pick; what a player sees best is the
pictures against the area's own maps (`src_bNN_*.png`). A sweep of them
found what the numbers missed: arenas paved with walkway tiles
(`TILES_ARENA_FLOOR`; `TILES_ARENA_DRAWN` where the arena's layout must
stay as the legalizer made it: the Undernet's), edges whose own rim tiles failed the plain test and
were stood in for by inner panels (`TILES_RIMMED`), decorated panels
whose pieces turned up elsewhere (`skip_styles` with `SKIP_ANY_PIXEL`,
`SKIP_PALE`), and two floors sharing a hue told apart by shape
(`TILES_WALK_NARROW`).

The seams are counted only where a tile is partly drawn: two whole tiles
side by side never make one, so a floor's inside can mix two of the
original's looks unseen by the count (the Undernet's bridges, a stripe
from one panel beside a gem's corner from another). Tried against that
and dropped, each over the count: taking a panel's tiles from one panel
of the original (its most typical for the neighbourhood: the bridges read
whole, the seams doubled at every panel border, the original alternating
two), the same by the panel's parity (no better), costing an unseen pair
of whole tiles 1 (2570 seams to 6098 over three areas: the edges paid for
the insides), laying straight walkway runs by their period (the
originals have too few runs five panels long to learn one), and for
CopyBot Comp's plateaus a rim context (a walkway panel beside platform
floor is a rim: its rims took the plateaus' stone, but the seams grew by
60% where they met the walkways' lips and legs), and for the Undernet's
bridges their gem joints as a floor of their own (platform floor to the
tiles, at a generated bridge's ends, turns and crossings: the gems'
pieces left the straight runs, but brown notches came where a stripe
lies beside a joint corner to corner, the seams up a quarter and the
near picks by half). What holds instead keeps both one floor and gives
the joints the pads' look (`joint_hues`, `TILE_PAD` at a generated
bridge's ends, turns and crossings while the tiles are picked): the
straight runs are plain planks, and the count rose a tenth on three
layers, where two stripes' posts meet side by side, which the originals
rarely set (a joint stands between); the baseline records it.

The close-ups in `.build/atlas/defects_bXX.png` show each spot. It fails as
the atlas does, where a layer got worse than the baseline; `--baseline`
writes the new numbers.

The check sees the classes' picks, not what is pasted over them (pads,
emblems, stairs, props), so look over the pictures too. To see why a tile
was picked, `CYBERWORLD_TILE_AT="x,y;x,y" python3 build.py atlas BIOME
SEEDS` prints every pair weighed for those tiles (tile x, y of the
uncropped layer: pixel over 8, plus the offset in its `.box` file), after
a `layer bXX_...` line for each layer.
