# How the switches work

- **Random battles** sets event flag 0x1700 every frame, one of the flags
  `checkThenStartBattle` (0x08005A8C) returns early for. The game clears it on
  entering a map, which is why it is set again each frame. Flag 0x173E, tested
  just after it, is the SlipRun state and is cleared by the player's own
  update each frame, so it cannot hold battles off. Forced battles (guardians,
  challenges) branch past these tests.
- **Can't die** writes the Navi stats' HP (0x020047CC +0x40 from +0x42) and,
  in battle, the HP of the T1 battle objects on MegaMan's side (0x0203A9B0,
  0xD8 bytes each: +0x16 alliance, +0x24 HP, +0x26 max HP).
- **One-hit enemies** and **Win this battle** lower the HP of the enemy side's
  T1 objects.
- **Speed** runs several emulator frames per frame shown; the director and
  the dev tools step after each.
