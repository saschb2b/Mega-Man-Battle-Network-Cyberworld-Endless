# Running the game's own logic

Battles, the net, menus, shops and messages run on BN6's own code, executed
from the player's ROM by an embedded [mGBA](https://mgba.io) core (0.10.5,
MPL-2.0, built by `docker/mgba.sh`). Cyberworld Endless is the director
around it: it generates each layer in the game's own formats, patches the
map tables of its in-memory ROM copy to point at them, and watches the game's
memory to move the run along. Nothing from the ROM is shipped.

| Layer | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| CPU, video, sound, input | mGBA core (`src/emu/emu.c`), presented through SDL |
| Battles, net movement, menus, messages, shops, traders | The game's code |
| Run structure, layer generation, loot, saves, the title | Cyberworld Endless |

## Memory the engine writes

The core runs a copy of the ROM padded to 16 MB. Everything the engine adds
lives past the original data, from `EMU_FREE` (`0x08800000`):

| Offset | Contents | Code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `+0x0000` | Warp record and warp list | `boot.c` |
| `+0x0100` | Warp stub (sets `BN6_ENGINE_MARK`, calls map_triggerEnterMapOnWarp) | `boot.c` |
| `+0x0180` | Encounter roll wrapper and trampoline | `encounter.c` |
| `+0x0200` | BattleSettings, `+0x0220` its entity list | `encounter.c` |
| `+0x2F00` | The layer map's warp list (entry 1: the exit pad) | `mapslot.c` |
| `+0x3000`-`+0x10000` | Layer data in two halves, one per layer in turn: NPC lists and scripts, text archive, Mystery Data, sprite list | `mapslot.c` |
| `+0x10000` | Generated tile map (LZ77, literal blocks) | `netmap.c` |
| `+0x60000` | Generated coordinate data (walls, the exit pad's trigger) | `coords.c` |

The engine also rewrites the stock of the game's shops 0 and 1 (in RAM and
in the initial table in ROM, `shop.c`), clears the Mystery Data flags
(`0x1400`+) and choice flags (`0x1440`+) it uses, sets the flags that stop
jacking out and the PET's Save (`0x1727`, `0x1706`), and borrows cbGameState
(`0x080050EC`) for one frame to warp.

## A layer

1. `net_gen.c` generates rooms, walkways and objects from the run seed.
2. `netmap.c` builds the area's tile map from tiles learned per class from
   one original map (`area_src.c`), and its wall list, and points the map's
   descriptor and coordinate data at them.
3. `layer_objs.c` turns the objects into NPC scripts (`npc.c`), text
   (`text.c`, `scripts.c`), Mystery Data and shop stock, and `mapslot.c`
   points the map's NPC list, scripts, objects, Mystery Data and sprite list
   at them.
4. `boot.c` warps MegaMan in with the game's own warp.

The exit pad is the game's own warp pad: trigger cells that take warp 1 of
the map's warp list. When MegaMan steps on it, the game starts its jack-out;
the director builds the next layer meanwhile and points warp 1 at its start,
so the game jacks him in there. A guardian Navi keeps the pad shut (flag
`0x16F1`) until he is beaten.

`director.c` then watches the game: the exit pad's warp, choices made in text (event flags set by
Yes), battles won (viruses counted, bosses beaten), the game's GAME OVER
(the run ends), MegaMan on any other map for 90 frames (warped back to
the layer's start), and a checkpoint shortly after each arrival (`run.sav` plus
the core's `run.state`). CONTINUE loads the state and enters the map again,
so the game reloads it from the current build's tables.

## Boot

`emu_boot` resets the core, presses through the title and NEW GAME, warps to
Seaside Area 1 and ends the intro cutscene, then saves `boot-3.state` in the
data directory. Later runs start from that state. It is made on the device
and never shipped.

## Testing

`CYBERWORLD_AUTOPILOT=1` walks MegaMan to each exit and presses through
battles. `CYBERWORLD_EMU_DEBUG=1` prints the depth, game mode, position and
map every 30 frames, prints the generated walls, and writes the tile map to
`.build/gen_tilemap.bin`.
`--net-biome N` puts every layer in one area.
