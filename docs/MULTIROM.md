# Other games' ROMs

Cyberworld Endless runs Battle Network 6: Cybeast Gregar in mGBA and
directs it. Where a player has other Battle Network games' ROMs beside
BN6's, they can lend a run what their data holds: more net areas, towns,
music, bystanders. BN6 stays the one ROM a run needs; each other is
optional, and the more there are, the bigger the pools a run draws from.

## Data, not code

Every battle, chip effect, virus AI and boss AI in a run is BN6's own
code; the engine directs it and writes data into BN6's in-memory ROM
(docs/EMULATION.md). Battle Network 4, 5 and 6 share one engine family:
their maps, tile sets, palettes, coordinate data, sprites, text scripts,
chip tables and MP2K songs are the same formats or close to them. A
second game's data can be drawn and played by BN6; its code cannot run
inside BN6 (it calls its own game's addresses).

| Pool | How another game fills it | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Net areas | Its maps learned as BN6's are (`tiles.c`), its tile set and palette copied into BN6's free space | moderate |
| Towns | The same, from its real-world maps | moderate |
| Music, sounds | Its MP2K songs and their voice groups into BN6's song table | low |
| NPCs, mugshots | Its sprites as bystanders and dealers | low to moderate |
| Chips | Where BN6 has the behaviour (most standard chips); its own (Navi chips, DarkChips) have no code in BN6 | limited |
| Viruses | The families both games have; its own need their AI | limited |
| Guardians | Its Navis need their AI: a battle in its own engine | high |

For what needs its game's code, the way is a battle in that game: the
engine keeps BN6's state, switches the core to the other ROM from a state
made there, sets up its battle (MegaMan's HP, his folder in its chips),
runs it, reads the result and brings BN6 back. That takes a battle-level
port of the other game (its RAM, as `src/emu/bn6.h` is BN6's), a second
ROM in memory, and shows its battle screens.

## How it is built

1. **Extra ROMs** (`src/core/rom.c`, `XR[]`): found in the ROM's folder by
   their header's game code and SHA-1, read and never run
   (`xrom_find`). Each has its layout (`XRomLayout`): its tables, found by
   their structure (`tools/rom_tables.py`) and noted in docs/ROM_DATA.md.
2. **A map from any of them** (`area_src_load_x`): the map reader takes
   its maps from the game's ROM; what learns from a map (`tiles.c`,
   `props.c`, `decor.c`, `stairs.c`) works on the decoded map, whichever
   game it came from, and each map keeps where it was read (`AreaSrc.rom`).
3. **Into BN6**: another game's areas (`XRomLayout.areas`, the same
   `NetAreaDef` as BN6's own, numbered after BN6's 19) name the BN6 map
   their layers take over (`over`) and the BN6 area whose layouts and
   furnishings they take (`like`). A layer in another game's tiles copies
   that game's tile set (its two blocks decoded and encoded again, after a
   header of its own) and palette into BN6's in-memory free space
   (`+0x170000`, docs/EMULATION.md), and the taken-over map's descriptor
   points at them. BN5's tile sets fill the same VRAM as BN6's (their
   first block at 0, the second after it: 31200 bytes against 30496).
4. **Pools by source**: each area, town, song and bystander is an entry
   with the game it came from; BN6 alone is today's game.
5. **Runs follow the games there**: an area of another game dresses the BN6
   area it is like (`run_dress`): its layouts, guardian and battles are
   that area's, its tiles, name and theme its own. A theme (`xsong`, a song
   in its game's song table) is copied into BN6's free space with what it
   plays on (`src/audio/xsong.c`): its sequence with the pointers moved,
   the voices it selects, their key splits, drum kits and samples, and
   entered in one of BN6's 61 empty song slots, where BN6's own sound
   engine plays it as one of its own. The run's seed picks it,
   with the ROMs present, so nothing is saved: a run continued without
   the other ROM goes on in the BN6 area's tiles.
6. **Platforms**: desktop first. A New 3DS's 96 MB heap holds BN6 twice
   (mGBA's copy and the engine's) with little room left: there another
   game's data would be taken in as a run needs it, its ROM not kept.

## Status

- [x] Battle Network 5: Team Colonel (USA): its map and coordinate
  tables, its maps drawn through the engine's map reader (`--atlas
  DIR:x0`: ACDC Town, Lan's room, the harbour, the net areas from 0x80).
- [x] One of its net areas drawn in the game: ACDC Area 1 (0x90:0), its
  cyan platforms and green walkways learned, its tile set and palette in
  BN6's free space, taking over Central Area 1 and laid out as Central
  Area (`--net-biome x0`; `--atlas DIR:a0:SEEDS` draws its layers).
- [x] Its ACDC Area in runs: it dresses Central Area in half the runs where
  Team Colonel sits beside BN6's ROM (`run_dress`, from the run's seed and
  the ROMs there: no save changes, and a run continued without it goes on
  in Central Area's tiles), named on the act's card, in MegaMan's words,
  L's and the PET's. Read where BN6's ROM is, on every build but the 3DS's
  and the browser's.
- [x] SciLab (maps 4-6, dressing Sky Area), End Area (7-9, Seaside Area)
  and Nebula Area (13-14, the Graveyard, under Green Area's map: the
  Graveyard's group sets its own palette), each tuned over the atlas's
  layers (`--atlas DIR:aN:3`).
- [ ] Oran Area (2-3: three walkway looks, two of platforms) and its
  Undernet (10-12), which the same tuning left at twice the seams.
- [x] Its areas' themes, from its own map-music lists: ACDC Area, SciLab
  and End Area its net theme (song 0x13), Nebula Area its Undernet's
  (0x14).
- [ ] Its other music (towns, battles).
- [ ] Its towns and bystanders.
- [ ] Its guardians, in battles in its own engine.
- [ ] Team ProtoMan (the other version), Battle Network 4, BN6 Falzar.
